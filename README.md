# Google_Dublin AirQuality Hackathon
 Google car has been collecting air quality data on the streets of Dublin for the last two years and this data was released to us with the goal of obtaining insights that could mitigate air pollution in Dublin specifically around levels of N02 and PM2.5. We used bigquery to read the data and various open source tools such as OSM to overlay the data.
